<H1>Introduction</H1>

It is possible to use Zeus and the visilog software to capture 
colour images.  Because of the 8 bit deep frame buffer the 
procedure is divided into several stages, explained in the next sections.
The captured pictures can be converted in to almost any format. eg.
PPM, TIFF, GIF etc.
